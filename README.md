# 🛒 End-to-End E-Commerce Machine Learning-Based Recommendation System

Welcome to **End-to-End E-Commerce Machine Learning-Based Recommendation System**! This project implements a **machine learning-based recommendation system** to enhance user shopping experiences by suggesting relevant products based on browsing history, purchase behavior, and item popularity.

## 📌 Project Overview
- 🤖 **Personalized Recommendations:** Uses machine learning to tailor product suggestions  
- 🏷 **User Behavior Tracking:** Analyzes purchase history, clicks, and preferences  
- 📊 **Collaborative & Content-Based Filtering:** Hybrid approaches for better accuracy  
- 🚀 **Scalability & Efficiency:** Optimized for large-scale e-commerce datasets  

## 📂 Data Format
The system processes structured datasets with the following attributes:
- `User ID` – Unique identifier for each customer  
- `Product ID` – Unique identifier for each item  
- `Category` – Classification of product (Electronics, Clothing, etc.)  
- `Purchase History` – Past transactions associated with a user  
- `User Clicks` – Items interacted with before purchase  
- `Ratings & Reviews` – Customer feedback on purchased items  

## 🔧 Installation
Clone the repository to start building the recommendation system:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/E-Commerce-Recommendation-System.git
cd E-Commerce-Recommendation-System
pip install -r requirements.txt


🚀 How to Use
- Load the dataset and preprocess user interactions
- Train the recommendation model using collaborative/content-based filtering
- Generate product recommendations for individual users
Example usage in Python:
from recommender import RecommendationEngine

recommender = RecommendationEngine("ecommerce_data.csv")
recommendations = recommender.get_recommendations(user_id=12345)
print(recommendations)
